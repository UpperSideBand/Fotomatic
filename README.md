# Fotomatic
CodeCademy Fotomatic Project.

In this project I will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. 

I will update it to look and work exactly the same as the specs do.

As I fix Fotomatic’s bugs, I will use the skills I acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help me decipher and update the site’s CSS.

Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow me to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.
